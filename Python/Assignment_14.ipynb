    "<p> <b> Ans:- <br> Multithreading is defined as the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently. <br> Multithreading is a threading technique in Python programming to run multiple threads concurrently by rapidly switching between threads with a CPU help (called context switching). <br> Besides, it allows sharing of its data space with the main threads inside a process that share information and communication with other threads easier than individual processes. <br> Multithreading aims to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which increases performance, speed and improves the rendering of the application. <br> </b> </p>"

Python threads will NOT make your program faster if it already uses 100 % CPU time. In that case, you probably want to look into parallel programming. <br> 1) activeCount(): <br> threading.activeCount() − Returns the number of thread objects that are active. <br> 2) currentThread(): <br> threading.currentThread() − Returns the number of thread objects in the caller's thread control. <br> 3) enumerate(): <br> threading.enumerate() − Returns a list of all thread objects that are currently active. </b> </p>"

    "<p> <b> Ans:- <br><br> Deadlocks:- <br> When two processes are waiting for each other directly or indirectly, it is called deadlock. <br> This usually occurs when two processes are waiting for shared resources acquired by others. <br> For example, If thread T1 acquired resource R1 and it also needs resource R2 for it to accomplish its task. <br> But the resource R2 is acquired by thread T2 which is waiting for resource R1(which is acquired by T1). <br> Neither of them will be able to accomplish its task, as they keep waiting for the other resources they need. <br> A deadlock is a concurrency failure mode where a thread or threads wait for a condition that never occurs.<br> The result is that the deadlock threads are unable to progress and the program is stuck or frozen and must be terminated forcefully.<br>There are many ways in which you may encounter a deadlock in your concurrent program. Deadlocks are not developed intentionally, instead, they are an unexpected side effect or bug in concurrency programming.<br> Common examples of the cause of threading deadlocks include: <br> 1) A thread that waits on itself (e.g. attempts to acquire the same mutex lock twice).<br>2) Threads that wait on each other (e.g. A waits on B, B waits on A).<br>3) Thread that fails to release a resource (e.g. mutex lock, semaphore, barrier, condition, event, etc.).<br>4) Threads that acquire mutex locks in different orders (e.g. fail to perform lock ordering). <br> Deadlocks may be easy to describe, but hard to detect in an application just from reading code. <br><br> Race Conditions:- <br> When two processes are competing with each other causing data corruption. <br> For example, if two processes/threads are trying to execute the following conditions simultaneously, they cause data corruption: <br> Thread 1: <br> total = num1 + num2 <br> Thread 2: <br> total = num1 - num2 <br> It is very common for the race conditions to go unnoticed during testing even after multiple tests and code reviews. But in production, there would be a lot of processes and threads working parallelly and compete for the same resources, and this problem would occur. </b> </p>"
