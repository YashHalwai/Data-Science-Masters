    "<p> <b> Ans:- <br> The open() function opens a file, and returns it as a file object. <br><br> Different modes of opening a file: <br> a) ‘r’ mode <br> b) ‘w’ mode <br> c) ‘a’ mode <br> d) ‘r+’ mode <br> e) ‘w+’ mode <br> f) ‘a+’ mode <br> g) Using ‘b’ with any mode <br><br> i) In ‘r’ mode, the file opens in the read mode. By default, if we don’t specify the mode argument, it will be treated as read or ‘r’ mode. <br> For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in ‘r’ mode: <br> open(\"myfile.txt\") or open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r\") <br><br> ii) In the ‘w’ mode, the file opens in write mode. It removes existing content, if present, in the file. If the specified file doesn’t exist, it creates one with the specified name. <br> For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in ‘w’ mode: <br> open(\"myfile.txt\", \"w\") <br><br> iii) In the ‘a’ mode, the file opens in append mode. It adds content to an existing file (or append at the end of the file). If the specified file doesn’t exist, it creates one with the specified name. It does not remove the existing content from the file. <br> For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in ‘a’ mode: <br> open(\"myfile.txt\", \"a\") <br><br> iv)  In the ‘r+’ mode, the file opens in the read & write mode. It does not remove existing content, if present, in the file and does not create a file if not present in the directory. <br> For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in ‘r+‘ mode: <br> open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r+\") <br><br> v) In the ‘w+’ mode, open the file in the read & write mode & remove existing content. If the file doesn’t exist, it creates a new one. It does not remove existing content & if a file doesn’t exist, it creates a new one. <br> For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in ‘w+’ mode:<br> open(\"myfile.txt\", \"w+\") <br><br> vi)  In the ‘a+’ mode, the file opens in the read & append mode. It does not remove existing content & If the file doesn’t exist, it creates a new one. <br> For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in a+ mode: <br> open(\"myfile.txt\", \"a+\") <br> <br> The modes discussed above are being used on a text file. To use these modes for a binary file, we need to use a different combination of file opening mode arguments. Using ‘b’ with any mode, For example, ‘ab’, ‘rb’, ‘wb’, ‘rb+’, the file opens in binary mode. It is used for non-textual files like image, sound, executable (.exe) files.<br>For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in b mode:\n",
    "<br>open(\"myfile.txt\", \"rb\")\n",
    "Opening a file is not enough. This open function needs to be stored into a variable as this will be used later for writing & reading the file. Here we will assign a variable to our file:<br>file = open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r\")</b> </p>"

If an exception occurs before the end of the block, it will close the file before the exception is caught by an outer exception handler. <br> Using with means that the file will be closed as soon as you leave the block. This is beneficial because closing a file is something that can easily be forgotten and ties up resources that you no longer need.</b></p>"
